An "event manager" program made as part of The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course: 
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/event-manager-ruby-programming#initial-setup

This project made use of 'file', reading content from CSV files, accessing Googles Civic Information API and using ERB for templating

Instead of having a seperate branch dealing with the same program I opted for having a second program to differentiate clearly what part was the tutorial and which portion was self-led.

The event_manager.rb file contains the intial part of the tutorial portion of the project. The event_manager_futher_iterations.rb file has an extended version of the same program with some suggested iterations from the project page for cleaning phone number formats and finding peak hours & days of user activity.

**Things to complete**
* Clean phone number data
* Time targeting
* Day of the week targeting
